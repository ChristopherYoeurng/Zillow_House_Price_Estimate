# Zillow_House_Price_Estimate
Welcome to my first ever neural network. 
We did this using the house price data taken off of kaggle, from a challenge for zillow. 
This was done using a 10 input, two 32 node layer, neural network, with a mean squared error loss function. 
super basic stuff but still very fun. 

hope you enjoyed,
definitely come see my stuff again
